MCUSim
======

An interactive simulator for microcontrollers (MCUSim) is a set of programs
used to run ROM file which is intended to be burned into an integrated
circuit, and analyse electronic schematic built by utilizing the curcuit.
Main goal of the project is to save time debugging code for an embedded system
and provide a detailed information of the processes in the circuit under
analysis on the spot, interactively.

Getting started with the simulator
----------------------------------

  - Make sure you have installed CMake build system version 3.2 or above.
    It is used to prepare makefiles (or other build files) for many platforms
    and environments. Installed version can be checked by a command running
    in your terminal:

      cmake --version

  - Any C compiler which follows ISO/IEC 9899:1990 standard (widely known
    as C89, C90 or ANSI C)

  - If you have all of these programs above installed, build a required part
    of the simulator (let me use avrsim as an example):

      cd avrsim
      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake ..

  - Each part of the simulator can be configured before building.
    You are perfectly able to consult with the README files placed in the
    specific directories.

If something goes wrong
-----------------------

  - If you need any help regarding the project, please write to
    Dmitry Salychev darkness.bsd<at>gmail.com or open an issue at

  - Help in any form (reporting a bug, code donation, etc.) is appreciated
    a lot.
